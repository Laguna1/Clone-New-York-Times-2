                    <p class="t-all">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan
                        Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
                        equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that
                        should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the
                        universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
                        have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the
                        universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look
                        uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron
                        out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
                        beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a
                        double box around it.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had
                        seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation,
                        looked right.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#" class="ins-t-all">
                            the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers
                        led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the
                        fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#" class="ins-t-all">gravitational waves</a> — the
                        signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
                        trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
                        inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including
                        Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to
                        the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It
                        would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion
                        light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch
                        in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own
                        universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like
                        a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>

                                there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even

                                and how much it has cooled.

                                another explanation.

                                coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even

                                in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the
                                large-scale structures of the universe.

                                the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the

                    <p class="t-all">Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.
                    </p>
                    <p class="t-all">Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such
                        a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
                        “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>
                    <p class="t-all">The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of
                        observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered
                        drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at
                        Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in
                        1979), in his office last week.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said
                        Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular
                        variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the
                        Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, <a
                            href="#" class="ins-t-all">knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne</a> to tell him
                        the news.</p>

                <div>
                    <p class="t-all">Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but
                        we did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30
                        years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still
                        hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been
                        seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p class="t-all">Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this
                        stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”</p>
                    <p class="t-all">John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a
                        competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think
                        the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits
                        the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result
                        would eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for
                        confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps
                        of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions
                        about the universe.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its
                        own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from
                        balloons, mountaintops and space.</p>
                    `Spirals in the Sky`
                    <p class="t-all">Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic
                        microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50
                        years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one
                        of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes
                        at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are
                        Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of
                        Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>

                    <p class="t-all">Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity,
                        electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those
                        are simply different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its
                        earliest, hottest moments.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like
                        some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics
                        evolved, with one force after another splitting away.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls
                        below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent
                        heat.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In
                        that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of
                        antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the
                        repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion
                        trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in
                        less than a cosmic eye-blink.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and
                        radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable
                        universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there
                        is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the
                        ultimate free lunch.”</p>
                    <p class="t-all">Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest
                        that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable
                        homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles
                        endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking
                        about going any deeper into the past.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because
                        inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial
                        moment are swept away, forever out of our view.</p>
                    <p class="t-all">“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian
                        astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”</p>
